# Welcome to my Wiki

On here, I write down lots of stuff I learn and stuff I want to remember. I also write down some of my homework.

Most of the things are probably not interesting for you, but if you want to read through it, feel free to do so.

However, some of the things might be interesting for you, I've listed them below.

Also, please note that these are things I learned. I'm not an expert on many of these topics, so things I write down might be wrong or incomplete.

Some things might also be my own opinions or theories. While I try to indicate these, I can't guarantee that won't ever forget.

Also, I can't always update everything, so some things may be outdated.
