### Wednesday

Wednesday is a very interesting character. While she looks and acts very emotionless, there are always these small moments in which we can see her emotions coming through a bit.
Personally, I can actually relate to Wednesday in many ways.

### Enid

Enid is an absolutely amazing piece of cuteness. She's an absolute comfort character. Enid is an extrovert and always positive. She just spreads positivity and good vibes everywhere.
